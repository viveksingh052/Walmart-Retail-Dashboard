# ðŸš€ Walmart Sales Dashboard | Advanced Excel Analytics Project

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project: **Walmart Global Sales Dashboard**, built entirely using **Microsoft Excel**.  
The project dives deep into **sales performance**, **profitability**, **returns**, and **regional management insights** â€” all brought together into a clean, interactive dashboard.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This project replicates a real-world business scenario where multiple teams (sales, operations, finance) interact.  
The data spans multiple countries and product categories and includes customer, order, return, and regional manager data.

We answer key business questions such as:
- Which market generates the highest revenue?
- How do returns impact overall profitability?
- Which managers oversee the highest-performing regions?
- What categories drive the most profit?
